# Issue Bulk Creation Requests

The `codex` CLI is not available in this environment (`bash: command not found: codex`).
Until the tool is installed, bulk issue creation requests are tracked as JSON payloads in this directory so they can be replayed later once the CLI becomes available.

Each file captures the milestone, defaults, and issues array exactly as the `codex issues bulk-create` command expects.
